### Hi there

I'm Cosmin Apreutesei, a programmer from Bucharest. Most of my open source stuff is at [luapower.com](https://luapower.com), a project with a lot of code that I keep at [github.com/luapower](https://github.com/luapower), which is why you don't see much coding activity in here, even though my stats say otherwise.
