#### Luapower

[Luapower](https://github.com/luapower/website/blob/master/luapower-www/md/github.md) 
is a LuaJIT toolkit (Windows, Linux), with native OS API bindings to portable sockets, 
threads, windows, graphics, etc. Comes with documentation, binaries and the ability
to create single-executable apps (desktop or command-line). 

#### Multigit

[multigit](https://github.com/capr/mgit) is a tool for checking out multiple git repositories 
overlaid onto the same directory, similar to a union filesystem, where each repository is a layer. 
Used as the package manager for luapower. Other people use it to keep their home directory 
under version control.
