Hi, I'm Cosmin, a programmer from Bucharest. 

## Stuff I'm working on

#### Canvas-UI

[canvas-ui](https://github.com/allegory-software/canvas-ui) 
is a UI library with an IMGUI API and built-in screen sharing.
JavaScript, canvas-drawn.

#### Allegory SDK

[Allegory SDK](https://github.com/allegory-software/allegory-sdk) is a fast web server 
and library stack written in Lua. It's aimed at automating the making of CRUD apps,
but its library-not-frameowrk pyramid-of-abstraction approach makes it versatile
for doing anything from web services to websites to SPAs and anything in between.

#### Miniterra

[miniterra](https://github.com/capr/miniterra) is a programming language 
with C semantics and lisp-like metaprogramming capabilities.

## Past projects

#### Luapower

[Luapower](https://github.com/luapower/website/blob/master/luapower-www/md/github.md) 
is a modular and portable LuaJIT toolkit (Windows, Linux), with everything from native OS API bindings
to portable sockets, threads, windows, graphics, etc. Comes with documentation, binaries and 
the ability to create single-executable apps (desktop or command-line). 

#### Multigit

[multigit](https://github.com/capr/mgit) is a tool for checking out multiple git repositories 
overlaid onto the same directory, similar to a union filesystem, where each repository is a layer. 
Used as the package manager for luapower. Other people use it to keep their home directory 
under version control.
