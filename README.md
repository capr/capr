Hi, I'm Cosmin, a programmer from Bucharest.

## Stuff I'm working on

#### Canvas-UI

At the moment I'm working on [canvas-ui](https://github.com/allegory-software/canvas-ui), 
a UI library with an IMGUI API, built-in screen sharing, and other interesting bits.
Written in JavaScript, canvas-drawn.

#### Allegory SDK

Concurrently I'm working on [Allegory SDK](https://github.com/allegory-software/allegory-sdk), 
a fast web server and library stack written in Lua. It's aimed at automating the making of 
large and complicated business apps, but its library-not-frameowrk pyramid-of-abstraction
approach makes it very versatile for doing anything from web services to websites to SPAs
and anything in between.

#### Miniterra

I also work on [miniterra](https://github.com/capr/miniterra) when I can.
It's a programming language with some cool metaprogramming capabilities.

#### Blag

Finally, I keep a [blag](https://github.com/capr/blag) in here 
and [a friend's old polaroids](https://rawgit.com/capr/oldbeat/master/index.html), 
if you're into that sort of thing.

## Past projects

#### Luapower

[Luapower](https://github.com/luapower/website/blob/master/luapower-www/md/github.md) 
is a modular and portable LuaJIT toolkit (Windows, Linux), with everything from native OS API bindings
to portable sockets, threads, windows, graphics, etc. Comes with documentation, binaries and 
the ability to create single-executable apps (desktop or command-line). 

#### Multigit

[multigit](https://github.com/capr/mgit) is a tool for checking out multiple git repositories 
overlaid onto the same directory, similar to a union filesystem, where each repository is a layer. 
Used as the package manager for luapower. Other people use it to keep their home directory 
under version control.
