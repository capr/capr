Hi, I'm Cosmin, a programmer from Bucharest. Most of my open source stuff is at [luapower.com](https://luapower.com) which is why you don't see much coding activity in here even though my stats say otherwise.

I do keep a [scrapbook/blog/wiki](https://github.com/capr/scrapbook) in here and [a friend's old polaroids](https://rawgit.com/capr/oldbeat/master/index.html), if you're into that sort of stuff.

[Multigit](https://github.com/capr/mgit) is also in here if you were looking for that.
