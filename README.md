### Hi there!

I'm Cosmin, a programmer from Bucharest. Most of my open source stuff is at [luapower.com](https://luapower.com), a project with a lot of code that I keep at 
[github.com/luapower](https://github.com/luapower) which is why you don't see much coding activity in here even though my stats say otherwise.

I do keep a [scrapbook/blog/wiki](https://github.com/capr/scrapbook) in here and [a friend's old polaroids](https://github.com/capr/oldbeat), if you're into that sort of stuff.

Oh, and [multigit](https://github.com/capr/mgit) is also in here if you were looking for that.
